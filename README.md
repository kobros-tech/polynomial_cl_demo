# polynomial-cl-demo

A small NumPy-only research instrument for one hypothesis:

> Incremental polynomial feature expansion, combined with appropriate knowledge-preservation mechanisms (replay, per-coefficient update rules), can improve a model's ability to learn **new classes** while retaining what it already knows.

The project is a continual-learning study first and a machine-learning library second. It does **not** assume the answer is yes. Every mechanism (zero-initialised expansion, freezing, per-coefficient learning rates, replay, a preserved old function) can be switched on and off independently, and every score, coefficient and prediction change is recorded.

> This project studies _explicit_ polynomial feature expansion, which is related to polynomial kernels. It does not implement an implicit-kernel SVM.

## Research map

| | setting | question | where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **primary** | **class-incremental learning (CIL)**: ten classes arrive in five two-class experiences, one softmax head | Does expansion (with replay and update rules) let new classes arrive without erasing old ones? | `src/polynomial_cl/continual/`, `experiments/class_incremental.py`, `experiments/rate_selection.py`, notebook 02 Part I |

This is **not** class-incremental learning: the label set never changes | `src/polynomial_cl/binary/` (experiences, replay, sequential loop), `models/binary.py`, `training/binary.py`, `experiments/synthetic_degree_ablation.py`, notebook 02 Part II |

Class-incremental learning and sequential binary classification under a shifting input distribution are different settings, and results from one must not be presented as results for the other. Conventional joint training (notebook 01) is only a reference point: it sees all data at once, so it has no sequence of experiences and no forgetting.

This README describes the structure, protocols and commands. It deliberately records no measured results or research conclusions: those are produced by running the notebooks and experiment scripts, and are reviewed in a separate research-results change. This README is the project's only documentation file.

## Architecture

Binary learning and class-incremental learning are different tasks, but they share one polynomial foundation:

```

- **Shared foundation.** Both models enumerate monomials in the same order, so the features of degree _d_ are a prefix of those of degree _d_ + 1. A model grows by appending zero coefficients, which leaves every existing output unchanged. This expansion invariant is tested on actual outputs for both model types (`tests/test_features.py`, `tests/test_multiclass_model.py`, `tests/test_binary_expansion.py`).
- **Binary versus multiclass.** The two models have different outputs, losses and prediction rules and share no trainer or base class. The binary model is a logistic regression on one score; the multiclass model is a softmax head whose prediction only considers the classes introduced so far.
- **Multiclass and class-incremental learning.** `polynomial_cl.continual` uses the multiclass model and its trainer and never imports binary code (enforced by `tests/test_architecture.py`). The experience sequence, replay memory, update strategies and per-degree learning rates are class-incremental concerns and live there, not in the generic data or model modules.
- **Synthetic target interface.** `polynomial_cl.data.make_synthetic_dataset(target_function=..., n_samples=..., seed=..., kind=...)` takes the target geometry as an argument. `sinusoidal_target` (`y = 1 iff x2 > 0.5 sin(3 x1)`) is the default everywhere; `circular_target` (a circle of radius 0.7 at the origin) and `make_circular_target(center, radius)` give a different geometry with the same labels convention. A target only says how labels are generated; how experiences are cut from the data belongs to the experiment (`polynomial_cl.binary` cuts vertical strips).
- **Notebooks.** `notebooks/01_joint_training.ipynb` is the non-continual reference (targets, degree, training budget, Split MNIST joint training). `notebooks/02_continual_learning.ipynb` is the continual-learning study (protocol, expansion invariant, capacity, sampling and replay, the six strategies, per-degree learning rates, Split MNIST across seeds). Each section starts from a research question and states what the executed cells do and do not show.

## Setup

Only Python, NumPy, Matplotlib and Jupyter are used (no PyTorch / TensorFlow / scikit-learn / pretrained models). CPU only.

```bash
cd polynomial-cl-demo
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate     # optional
pip install -e ".[dev]"                                # numpy, matplotlib + pytest, jupyter, nbformat, nbconvert
python -m pytest                                       # fast test suite (seconds)
python -m pytest -m slow                               # executes both notebooks in a clean kernel (minutes)
jupyter lab notebooks/                                 # or: jupyter notebook
```

Notebooks are committed without outputs (small diffs); run them to regenerate every figure and table. To re-execute them headlessly:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --inplace notebooks/0*.ipynb
```

The notebooks call package code only and run their own experiments (reduced where the full study is expensive); they never read result files from `results/`. Notebook 01 is the joint-training reference (synthetic sinusoid and circle targets, degree and training budget, Split MNIST joint training). Notebook 02 is the continual-learning notebook (its configuration cell sets `sampling` explicitly to `shuffled`, the protocol of the earlier experiments): Part I is class-incremental learning (protocol, expansion invariant, capacity, sampling and replay, the six update strategies, per-degree learning rates, stability across seeds) and Part II is the separate binary sequential experiment. The Split MNIST cells of both notebooks are skipped, with a message, when `data/mnist` is absent; the command-line tool downloads the archives (see below). Both notebooks fall back to `../src` if the package is not installed.

## Primary research: class-incremental learning

### Protocol

Ten classes arrive in five experiences of two classes each (`TASK_ORDER`). One ten-output softmax head is trained on the current experience plus a fixed per-class replay memory. During training **and** evaluation only the classes introduced so far compete, so the output weights of future classes are never trained. After each experience the model is evaluated on every experience seen so far, which fills a lower-triangular accuracy matrix; forgetting of an experience is the best accuracy it ever had minus its final accuracy, averaged over experiences 1-4 (the last has no later evaluation). Forgetting is computed by `polynomial_cl.metrics.forgetting`, the same function the binary experiment uses.

Three conditions share task order, replay indices, seed, optimiser and number of epochs, and differ only in polynomial degree:

| condition | degrees over the five experiences | what comparing it tells you |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fixed_linear` | 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 | baseline: no added capacity |
| `expanding` | 1, 2, 3, 3, 3 (new coefficients start at zero; logit change asserted below 1e-5) | `expanding` vs `fixed_linear`: value of capacity |
| `fixed_capacity` | 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 | `expanding` vs `fixed_capacity`: value of adding capacity gradually |

MNIST images are normalised and mapped to 16 dimensions by a fixed random orthonormal projection (never fitted to data) before the explicit polynomial map (17, 153, 969 features at degrees 1, 2, 3). Each degree group is divided by the square root of its size so that high-degree monomials do not dominate merely by being numerous.

```bash
python experiments/class_incremental.py --dataset synthetic_2d --output results/synthetic_2d.json
python experiments/class_incremental.py --dataset split_mnist  --output results/split_mnist.json   # downloads MNIST to data/mnist
python experiments/class_incremental.py --dataset split_mnist --sampling shuffled --output results/split_mnist_shuffled.json   # the earlier (shuffled) protocol
```

### Why old-class accuracy drops: takeover versus flips

Two different mechanisms lower the accuracy on old classes, and the accuracy matrix alone cannot separate them. Every record carries both:

- `old_takeover_fraction_by_task`: after training, **all** classes seen so far compete (as in the accuracy matrix) and a **new** class wins an old-class test input. This can happen although the old logits barely move.
- `old_flip_fraction_by_task`: only old classes compete, and the prediction changes between two old classes. This measures how much the old decision function itself moved.

`old_logit_change_by_task` is the largest change of any old-class logit on old-class test inputs. Large takeover with small flips points to a stability-plasticity imbalance between old and new classes; large flips point to damage to the old function.

### Update rules (`--experiment strategies`, `expanding` schedule)

`ordinary` (replay, everything trains), `ordinary_no_replay`, `frozen_old`, `small_old_lr` (old coefficients get 0.1 x the gradient) and `strategy_b` (every gradient is projected onto the null space of the design matrix at `--n-ref-per-class` stored inputs per old class, so the logits at those inputs cannot change). `strategy_b_new` is the binary `strategy_b_new`: old coefficients are frozen as in `frozen_old`, and the old classes' outputs may move only through newly added feature rows, inside the same null space; the new classes' columns use the full null space. A coefficient is _old_ if its feature row existed before the current experience **and** its class column was already introduced; new feature rows and the new classes' columns always train.

```bash
python experiments/class_incremental.py --dataset split_mnist --experiment strategies --output results/split_mnist_strategies.json
python experiments/class_incremental.py --dataset split_mnist --experiment strategies --n-ref-per-class 10 --output results/split_mnist_b10.json
```

Every record carries learning indicators that exist for _all_ rules: training loss before and after each experience, L1 size of the update, number of trainable coefficients, and the old-class change, flip and takeover diagnostics above. `null_dim` exists only for the two Strategy B variants and is a constraint diagnostic, not a general learning indicator. It is the free dimension for the old-class output columns (`strategy_b`: one basis shared by every column; `strategy_b_new`: the dimension left in the newly added feature rows, which is 0 in an experience that adds none), and `null_dim_new_class_columns` is the free dimension for the new classes' columns. `n_trainable` counts the directions that can actually move after the learning-rate vector is applied (zero-rate groups excluded).

### Per-feature learning rates and validated rate selection

`--feature-power p` gives feature i the step size `lr * (max_rms / rms_i) ** p` (p = 0: one shared rate; p = 1: diagonal preconditioning). `--validation-fraction 0.1` evaluates on a held-out part of the training data instead of the test set. `experiments/rate_selection.py` sweeps `(p, lr)` on that split, picks the best cell for each condition (or rule, with `--experiment strategies`) by validation accuracy only, and then reports the test result for the selected cells:

```bash
python -u experiments/rate_selection.py --dataset split_mnist --output results/rate_selection_conditions.json   # minutes
python -u experiments/rate_selection.py --dataset split_mnist --experiment strategies --output results/rate_selection_strategies.json
```

The seeds used for selection (`--select-seeds`, default 0 1) and for the reported test result (`--test-seeds`, default 2-6) must be disjoint: the script refuses overlapping sets, because otherwise the same stochastic runs would both choose the rates and be reported as the test estimate. Check where each selected cell lies in the grid: a selection on the boundary (`--powers`, `--lrs`) means the optimum may be outside it; widen the grid and rerun.

### Sampling policy and per-degree learning rates

Two further mechanisms are available for every update rule (`polynomial_cl.continual`).

**Sampling policy** (`sampling="class_balanced"` or `"shuffled"`; the default is `polynomial_cl.continual.sampling.DEFAULT_SAMPLING`, `class_balanced`, and the command-line tools take `--sampling`). `shuffled` is the behaviour of the earlier experiments: current and replay examples are shuffled together, so in the last experience a new class contributes about 5,900 examples per class against 200 stored for an old class. Pass `sampling="shuffled"` or `--sampling shuffled` to reproduce those runs; notebook 02 sets it explicitly for the sections that keep the earlier protocol. The default was set from the paired comparison of `--experiment sampling` below (same seeds, strategies, rates and replay memory), and the joint-training reference is unaffected (it has no replay). `class_balanced` builds every batch with (almost) equal numbers of every class seen so far; each class is read through its own shuffled cycle, a class with fewer examples than its share is repeated and never padded from another class, and classes with no examples (no replay) do not take part. Both policies make the same number of updates per epoch and use the same task plan and memory; the test set is never used. Every record stores the pool size, the number of examples actually drawn and the mean batch composition per class (`sampling_by_task`).

**Per-degree learning rates** (`learning_rate=` a scalar or a vector). This is a different mechanism from `feature_power`, which scales the step of every _individual feature_ by its RMS value; the per-degree vector sets one step size per degree _group_. Neither decides which polynomial dimensions exist (that is the degree schedule), and the two cannot be combined: setting both is rejected. The vector has one entry per polynomial degree group and position k is degree k (0: constant, 1: linear, 2: quadratic, 3: cubic); entries must be finite and non-negative, 0 freezes the group, and an all-zero vector is rejected. All groups train together in one run with their own rate in every update. A group that appears through expansion uses its own entry from the first update. The vector composes with update masks (`small_old_lr`, `frozen_old`) and with Strategy B, whose null-space projection is taken in the rate-scaled coordinates so the reference logits stay fixed; it cannot be combined with `--feature-power`, which is a different mechanism (a step size per _feature_ derived from the measured feature scale). The binary trainer's `_as_vector` is per _coefficient_ and is unrelated. Each record carries `degree_diagnostics`: per experience and degree group the rate, coefficient and trainable counts, raw-gradient and applied-step size, actual coefficient change (L1 and relative), the group's logit contribution and its contribution to old-class logit change.

```bash
python experiments/per_degree_lr.py --dataset split_mnist --experiment sampling --output results/per_degree/sampling_e3_lr0.1.json
# one JSON per (strategy, sampling), the full study (notebook 02 runs a reduced version itself and does not read these files). The whole study, resumable (skips finished cells):
bash experiments/run_per_degree_study.sh
python experiments/per_degree_lr.py --dataset split_mnist --experiment per-degree --strategies ordinary --samplings class_balanced --output results/per_degree/cell_ordinary_class_balanced.json
```

Protocol of the per-degree study: every candidate is measured on a 10% validation split (seeds 0-2) for final mean accuracy, mean forgetting and newest-experience accuracy, so accuracy alone never decides. The shared rate is chosen from {0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30}; one degree group at a time is then made 0.25x, 0.5x, 2x or 4x of it; one follow-up vector takes each group's best factor; and all vectors are run on the test set with disjoint seeds 3-9. The Pareto front on (accuracy, forgetting) is recorded for every cell; where one vector is needed, the front member with the largest accuracy minus forgetting is marked `selected` (optionally with a floor `--min-current-accuracy` on newest-experience accuracy). `selected` is a convenience for reading results, not a claim of optimality. Joint (shuffled, all-class) training on the same features is available as `run_joint_reference` and is shown in notebook 01; it has no forgetting.

### How to read the results

- **Training budget and rates.** The defaults (3 epochs, one shared rate 0.1) are a fixed historical protocol, not a tuned or converged setting. Do not treat default-rate results as evidence that one condition is better. Compare conditions only at rates selected **per condition on validation data**, over several seeds, and repeat with several `--epochs` values.
- **The ring is linearly solvable.** Equal isotropic Gaussian classes have linear Bayes boundaries, so that dataset checks the machinery and cannot reward extra capacity; Split MNIST and the binary sinusoid are the capacity tests. With the default 160 training samples per class the replay memory (200 per class) holds _all_ earlier data on the ring, whereas it is a genuine 200-example budget on MNIST. A genuinely nonlinear ten-class synthetic dataset is not yet implemented.
- **Seeds.** For the class-incremental runs the data, test sets and projection are fixed; seeds change shuffling and replay selection only, so the spread across seeds understates dataset-level variability.

## Supporting experiment: binary sinusoid

Inputs live in `[-1, 1]^2`. The true rule is `y = 1 iff x2 > 0.5 sin(3 x1)` (a nonlinear boundary). Experience _k_ of 10 samples `x1` from the _k_-th vertical strip and `x2` uniformly, so each experience reveals a different part of the boundary. This is sequential binary learning under a spatially shifting input distribution, **not class-incremental learning**. Each experience has its own training split and its own fixed test split (independent random streams). The model is `f_d(x) = w . phi_d(x)` with the bias as the coefficient of the constant feature. Starting at degree 1, the degree grows by one per experience (configurable via `degrees=`). Expansion appends zero coefficients and the loop **asserts** `f_{d+1}(x) = f_d(x)` for scores and probabilities on training, test, random and out-of-region inputs before any training.

```bash
python experiments/synthetic_degree_ablation.py --seeds 0 1 2 3 4 --output results/synthetic_degree_ablation.json
```

Within each seed the same generated experiences, replay budget, epochs and optimiser are used for `expanding` (degree 1..10), `fixed_initial_degree` (degree 1) and `fixed_capacity` (degree 10 from the start).

### Synthetic target functions and the joint-training reference

The target function is a parameter of the synthetic generator (`polynomial_cl.data.synthetic`). A target maps inputs of shape `(n, 2)` to a signed score and the label is `score > 0`. `sinusoidal_target` is the rule above and the default everywhere; `circular_target` (class 1 inside a circle of radius 0.7 around the origin; `make_circular_target(center, radius)` for others) is a geometry demonstration, not a benchmark. `make_synthetic_dataset(target_function, n_samples, seed, kind="train" | "test")` draws one reproducible dataset (the two kinds use independent random streams), and `make_experiences(..., target_function=...)` cuts the same target into vertical-strip experiences. How experiences are built is separate from the target, so the same target serves joint and sequential binary training. Joint training (all data at once, no forgetting) is run by `experiments/joint_training.py`:

```bash
python experiments/joint_training.py --target sinusoidal --output results/joint_sinusoidal.json
python experiments/joint_training.py --target circular --binary-degrees 1 2 3 --output results/joint_circular.json
python experiments/joint_training.py --experiment ten_class --dataset split_mnist --output results/joint_split_mnist.json
```

### Strategies (`make_config(name)`)

| name | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ordinary_no_replay` | one global learning rate, no replay |
| `ordinary` | one global learning rate, balanced replay |
| `frozen_old` | existing coefficients have mask False (never updated), new ones train |
| `small_old_lr` | existing coefficients use `lr_old_factor = 0.1` |
| `strategy_b_all` / `strategy_b_new` | as `ordinary`, plus **preserved old predictions**: `g(x_ref) = 0` enforced exactly on reference inputs |

- There are no separate `strategy_a_*` presets: an unconstrained `f = f_old + g` over all coefficients is the same optimisation problem as `ordinary`, and over only the new coefficients it is `frozen_old`. They are representational aliases, so they are not offered (this is tested).
- Strategy B constrains `g` only at finitely many reference inputs (the first 3 buffered inputs of every old experience, configurable). `g`'s coefficients are restricted to the null space of the reference design matrix (SVD), so `g(x_ref) = 0` holds to rounding. This says **nothing** about inputs elsewhere; the metrics measure how much old scores actually move on the full old test sets. If the constraint uses up every degree of freedom, `g` cannot learn and the run reports that (`null_dim = 0`); constraints are never relaxed automatically.
- Presets cannot be silently overridden: `make_config("ordinary_no_replay", m_replay=100)` raises.

### Replay policy

Each experience stores up to `capacity` training samples (seeded choice without replacement). A batch for experience _t_ contains `m_current` current samples plus `m_replay` samples from **each** earlier experience (int or `{exp_id: m}`), with or without replacement. If fewer than `m` rows are stored and sampling is without replacement, all stored rows are used (never padded, never taken from elsewhere). Actual per-experience counts are stored in `record.batch_counts`. `ReplayBuffer.add_experience` only accepts `Split(kind="train")`. The class-incremental runner uses a different, fixed per-class memory (`make_task_plan`), because its batches are formed from classes rather than experiences; the two replay policies are deliberately not merged.

### Metrics (per experience, identical for every strategy)

Current-experience accuracy; mean accuracy over observed experiences; `max |f_after - f_before|` over old test inputs; fraction of old test predictions that flipped; forgetting (best earlier accuracy minus current accuracy); max change of frozen coefficients (reported as unavailable when none are frozen), change in the preserved old component, maximum combined-coefficient change, and L1 update of trainable coefficients; for Strategy B also the change at reference inputs and the free dimensions left by the constraint.

Hyper-parameters of the binary experiment (`lr=0.5`, 300 epochs per experience, replay `m=100`, capacity 100) were fixed before the continual experiments were run and were not tuned afterwards; all strategies share them.

```

Run the scripts as `python experiments/<name>.py` from the repository root. Reusable experiment logic lives in the package (so a notebook can import `run_comparison()` without a command-line script); `experiments/` holds executable workflows and no entry point imports another. What is shared is mathematical infrastructure (monomials, zero expansion, forgetting, mean/std aggregation); what is kept separate is the learning protocol and objective (binary logistic regression with per-experience replay versus a masked ten-class softmax with per-class memory), the model (a binary model class versus a plain coefficient array) and the feature scaling (raw monomials versus degree-balanced). The class-incremental code has no dependency on the binary model or trainer.

## Tests

`python -m pytest` runs the fast suite (a few seconds); `python -m pytest -m slow` additionally executes every notebook top to bottom in a clean kernel (minutes; Split MNIST cells run only if `data/mnist` exists). The same two commands run in CI.

- Shared and binary code: `test_features` (ordering, counts, the shared enumeration and zero-expansion helpers, output-level expansion invariance for binary and multiclass), `test_binary_features`, `test_binary_expansion` (exact copy, zeros, identical scores and probabilities on train/eval/random/outside inputs, invariant checked every step of the loop), `test_binary_training` (finite-difference gradient, loss decrease, reproducibility, frozen coefficients, zero-init learning, per-coefficient learning rates, preservation tests, preset-override guard), `test_binary_replay`, `test_binary_data`, `test_binary_plotting`.
- Synthetic data: `test_synthetic_data` (sinusoidal experiences bit-identical to the pre-refactor generator, circular target geometry, reproducibility, independent train/test streams, label noise), `test_joint_studies`.
- Class-incremental code: `test_class_incremental` and `test_mnist` (features, expansion invariant and its guard, masked evaluation, forgetting definition, per-class accuracy, takeover versus flip diagnostics, determinism, offline Split MNIST), `test_multiclass_model`, `test_multiclass_training`, `test_strategies` (the update restrictions of the six strategies), `test_class_incremental_plotting`, `test_reporting_rows`.
- Per-degree rates and sampling: `test_per_degree` (vector validation, per-group parameter updates, zero rates, masks, Strategy B, expansion, class counts, no future-class draws, reproducibility, accuracy/forgetting).
- Replay and sampling: `test_replay_sampling` (memory draw and stored-index order, policy-to-sampler mapping, the trainer's injected sampler).
- Structure: `test_architecture` (import graph without cycles, class-incremental code independent of the binary code, binary/model/trainer code independent of the class-incremental code, entry points not importing each other, no stale imports in source, tests, experiments and notebooks).
- Workflows: `test_experiment_scripts` (the command-line tools) and `test_notebooks` (every notebook compiles, has unique valid cell ids, is committed without outputs, reads no result file, and executes cleanly under `-m slow`).

## Reproducibility

Everything is driven by explicit seeds (`np.random.default_rng([seed, experience, stream])` for the binary task; `default_rng(seed)` for task plans and `seed + experience` for training shuffles in the class-incremental runner). Re-running a notebook gives the same numbers. Generated experiment files go to `results/` (git-ignored); the tools need the package installed (`pip install -e .`).

## Degree-control experiment

`run_condition(..., degree_control_factors=[m0, m1, m2, m3])` multiplies the per-degree rates by factors in [0, 1] (effective rate `eta_d * m_d`; default all ones reproduces the original run bit for bit). The factors enter the diagonal step scale every strategy already uses, so Strategy B's null space is computed for the controlled step and its reference-logit preservation still holds. Protocol and selection rule: `src/polynomial_cl/continual/degree_control.py`.

```bash
python experiments/degree_control.py --dataset split_mnist --output results/degree_control.json
